Starlight is a full-featured documentation theme built on top of the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework.
This guide will help you get started with a new project.
See the [manual setup instructions](/manual-setup/) to add Starlight to an existing Astro project.

## Quick Start

### Create a new project

Create a new Astro + Starlight project by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm create astro --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn create astro --template starlight
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a new [project directory](/guides/project-structure/) with all the necessary files and configurations for your site.

:::tip[See it in action]
Try Starlight in your browser:
[open the template on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/starlight/tree/main/examples/basics).
:::

### Start the development server

When working locally, [Astro’s development server](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/cli-reference/#astro-dev) lets you preview your work and automatically refreshes your browser when you make changes.

Inside your project directory, run the following command to start the development server:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm run dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn dev
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will log a message to your terminal with the URL of your local preview.
Open this URL to start browsing your site.

### Add content

Starlight is ready for you to add new content, or bring your existing files!

Add new pages to your site by creating Markdown files in the `src/content/docs/` directory.

Read more about file-based routing and support for MDX and Markdoc files in the [“Pages”](/guides/pages/) guide.

### Next steps

- **Configure:** Learn about common options in [“Customizing Starlight”](/guides/customization/).
- **Navigate:** Set up your sidebar with the [“Sidebar Navigation”](/guides/sidebar/) guide.
- **Components:** Discover built-in cards, tabs, and more in the [“Components”](/components/using-components/) guide.
- **Deploy:** Publish your work with the [“Deploy your site”](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) guide in the Astro docs.

## Updating Starlight

:::tip
Because Starlight is beta software, there will be frequent updates and improvements.
Be sure to update Starlight regularly!
:::

Starlight is an Astro integration. You can update it and other Astro packages by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npx @astrojs/upgrade
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm dlx @astrojs/upgrade
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn dlx @astrojs/upgrade
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

See the [Starlight changelog](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/blob/main/packages/starlight/CHANGELOG.md) for a full list of the changes made in each release.

## Troubleshooting Starlight

Use the [project configuration](/reference/configuration/) and [individual page frontmatter configuration](/reference/frontmatter/) reference pages to ensure that your Starlight site is configured and functioning properly.
