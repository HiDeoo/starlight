## Sites

import ShowcaseSites from '../../components/showcase-sites.astro';

Starlight is already being used in production. These are some of the sites around the web:

<ShowcaseSites />

See all the [public project repos using Starlight on GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/network/dependents).

## Community plugins

These community [plugins](/reference/configuration/#plugins) work alongside Starlight to extend its functionality.

// TODO(HiDeoo) This new structure is a proposal and should only be used once we have at least a plugin to showcase.

## Community tools and integrations

import { CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

These community tools and integrations can be used to add features to your Starlight site.
